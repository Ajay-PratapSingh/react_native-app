<h4>Built a simple React Native app that uses Navigation, Axios, and Redux to fetch and display a
list of user posts from a remote API. The app should have the following features:<br/>
1. The app has two screens: a login screen and a list of posts screen.<br/>
2. The login screen has two input fields: email and password. The user is
able to enter their email and password and press a "login" button to authenticate with the
API.<br/>
3. If the user's email and password are correct, the app navigates to the list of posts
screen.<br/>
4. The list of posts screen should display a list of posts fetched from the API. Each post
should display the following information: title, body, and user name.<br/>
5. The user should be able to log out from the list of posts screen, which should navigate
back to the login screen.</h4>
